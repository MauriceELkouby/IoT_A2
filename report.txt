In my config.json file, I have two conditions, one of which would activate the heater when the temperature value goes below 18
and the other turns off the heater when the temperature reaches above 25
In my actor.py file it subscribes to the MQTT data to receive the on or off from the heater turning the potential relay on or off on request
In the control.py file I connect to the MQTT broker load the json file publishes results to topic with taking into account conditions
In my arduino file, I have the reading of a temperature sensor I got for my final project that I am using with my teamate. 
For the demonstration, I had Issues with the download wires, where only one was working, therefore I wasnt able to test it out(I will have to buy a new wire(micro usb I think)
